The main function of the "alx 0x17. Web stack debugging #3" project is to debug issues within a web stack. In web development, a "stack" typically refers to the combination of technologies used to build and run a web application. This could include components such as web servers, databases, programming languages, frameworks, and more.

Debugging in this context involves identifying and fixing errors, malfunctions, or unexpected behavior within the web stack. The "#3" in the project title suggests that it is the third installment in a series of debugging tasks.

Participants or learners working on this project would likely be tasked with identifying and resolving specific issues within a given web application or system. This could involve troubleshooting problems related to server configuration, code errors, database connectivity, or other aspects of the web stack.

Overall, the project aims to provide hands-on experience with debugging techniques specific to web development environments, helping participants enhance their skills in diagnosing and fixing issues in real-world scenarios.
