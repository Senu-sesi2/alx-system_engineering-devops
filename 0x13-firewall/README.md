# The core function of this project

The core function of the project "0x13. Firewall" is to teach students about network security and how to implement a basic firewall. A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## In this project, students are likely to learn:

* The fundamentals of network security and the role of firewalls in protecting systems from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
* How to configure and manage firewall rules to control traffic flow based on criteria such as IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.
* Understanding different types of firewalls, such as packet-filtering firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, and application-layer firewalls.
* Implementing basic firewall functionalities using tools like iptables or ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) in Linux-based systems.
* Testing and validating firewall configurations to ensure they effectively filter traffic while allowing legitimate communication.
* Overall, the "0x13. Firewall" project aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to set up and maintain a basic firewall configuration, enhancing the security posture of systems and networks they manage.
