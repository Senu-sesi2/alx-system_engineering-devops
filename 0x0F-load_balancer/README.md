# The main function of this project

A load balancer is a device or software application that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources, ensuring high availability and reliability by efficiently utilizing resources, preventing any single resource from being overloaded

The load balancer function 0x0F likely handles the task of distributing incoming requests from clients across multiple servers or instances of the ALX application, thereby optimizing resource utilization and improving the overall performance and reliability of the system. This function would involve algorithms to determine how to allocate incoming requests based on various factors such as server load, response time, and availability.
