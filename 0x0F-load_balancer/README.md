# The core mandate of the project

The main purpose of the ALX "0x0F. Load balancer" project is to teach students how to implement a basic load balancer. Load balancing is a critical aspect of web infrastructure management, especially in high-traffic scenarios where multiple servers are deployed to handle incoming requests.

The project involves tasks such as:

* Understanding the concept of load balancing and its importance in distributed systems.

* Implementing a simple load balancer algorithm, such as round-robin or least connections, to distribute incoming requests among multiple backend servers.

* Handling health checks to ensure that only healthy backend servers receive traffic.

* Dealing with issues such as session persistence (sticky sessions) if needed.

* Testing and validating the load balancer's functionality under various conditions, such as different loads and server failures.

* Overall, the project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in building a fundamental component of scalable and reliable web applications, preparing them for real-world scenarios in web development and system administration.
