## Postmortem for Web Stack Debugging #4

### Issue Summary

On 17th May, 2024, our web stack experienced a critical issue that affected the availability and performance of our online services. The incident, referred to as Web Stack Debugging #4, was caused by a complex interplay of factors, leading to a cascading failure of our infrastructure.

### Timeline

10:00 AM: The incident began with a sudden increase in error rates and latency in our API responses.
10:15 AM: Our monitoring tools alerted the team to the issue, but the lack of detailed logging hindered swift identification of the root cause
11:00 AM: The team started investigating, but the complexity of the issue led to a prolonged debugging process.
12:30 PM: A temporary fix was implemented, but it only partially mitigated the issue.
2:00 PM: A more comprehensive solution was developed and deployed, fully resolving the incident.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the incident was a combination of:1. Inadequate logging and monitoring configurations
2. Insufficient error handling in our application code
3. Unanticipated interactions between recently deployed features
4. Inadequate testing and QA procedureImpact
30-minute downtime for our API
20% increase in error rates for 2 hours
15% decrease in overall system performance for 4 hours

### Corrective and preventative measures

1. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring configurations to facilitate swift issue identification.
2. Enhance error handling in application code to prevent cascading failures.
3. Conduct thorough testing and QA procedures to uncover unanticipated interactions between features.
4. Develop more efficient debugging processes to minimize resolution time.

### Action Items

1. Review and update logging and monitoring configurations.
2. Conduct a thorough review of application code for error handling improvements.
3. Develop and implement additional testing scenarios to cover complex feature interactions.
4. Develop and document more efficient debugging procedures for future incidents.
By addressing these action items, we aim to significantly improve our web stack's reliability, performance, and debugging capabilities, minimizing the likelihood and impact of future incidents
